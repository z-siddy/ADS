## Content

 1. ADT Queue
> *First item added will be the first item to be removed*

 2. Depth-first search algorithm
> Depth first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. One starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

 3. Ulam spiral visualization
> The Ulam spiral is a simple method of visualizing the prime numbers that reveals the apparent tendency of certain quadratic polynomials to generate unusually large numbers of primes.
